# Image-data-augmentation-with-tensorflow
Data augmentation is a technique used to create more examples with the same dataset. It is useful when dataset is small and insufficient to train the model to have better performance. It is also useful to solve over-fitting so that model generalizes well on new examples.

## Following ways are being implemented to generate more number of data

- Rotation
- Width and Height Shifts
- Brightness
- Shear transformation
- Zoom
- Channel Shift
- Horizontal and Vertical Flips

## Platfrom Used - Google Colab
