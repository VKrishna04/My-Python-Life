    "# Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?\n",
    "## What is Programming\n",
    "Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. \n",
    "If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. \n",
    "How about 23453453 X 56456?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. \n",
    "This 100 days of code series will help you learn python from starting to the end. We will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a Job ready Python developer!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.\n",
    "-   Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.\n",
    "-   It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Python is simple and easy to understand.\n",
    "-   It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.\n",
    "-   Python is an open-source programming language.\n",
    "-   Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.\n",
    "-   It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python used for\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.\n",
    "-   Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.\n",
    "-   It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.\n",
    "-   It is used to create web applications.\n",
    "-   It can be used to handle databases.\n",
    "-   It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Replit?\n",
    "- Replit is very easy to share tutorials and code.\n",
    "- You can easily fork this repl and continue learning in your own style. Video, code as well as text tutorial on the same page which makes things easy!\n",
    "- For fellow teachers out there, you create a .tutorial folder to create tutorials using replit.\n",

    "Back in my college, I used to learn C and C++ programming in depth, used to score good marks. I created a bunch of printing, conditionals and loop program. Now what? I wanted to benefit from the same\n",
    "In my second year of college, I started working (I mean actually working in the industry) with the python programming language. I was not so good with it but I used to write code for a singaporean client and actually make good money without having to actually master Python. Harry then got curious and started working on his Python skills even more.\n",
    "I then got into web scraping and trust me I made some good easy money on Fiverr just by writing some python programs and charging on per webpage basis to my clients ( I used to automate scraping)\n",
    "\n",
    "I then learnt flask and got to work with Flask with a university professor abroad. Long story short, Python made a huge impact in my career.\n",

    "## What can Python do for you?\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to show you some python programs I created which will surely inspire you to create your own versions of the same as we progress through this tutorial. \n",
    "Do not try to recreate them just yet if you are a beginner and just started working on Python. We will make progress gradually trust me\n",

    "# Day 3 - Modules and pip in Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python:\n",
    "1. Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.\n",
    "2. External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The pip command\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be used as a package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install a python module.\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a module in Python (Usage)\n",
    "We use the import syntax to import a module in Python. Here is an example code:\n",

    "## What is a variable?\n",
    "Variable is like a container that holds data. Very similar to how our containers in kitchen holds sugar, salt etc\n",
    "Creating a variable is like creating a placeholder in memory and assigning it some value. In Python its as easy as writing:\n",

    "# Typecasting in python\n",
    "The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting in python or type conversion in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a wide variety of functions or methods like: int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), etc. for the type casting in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Types of Typecasting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explicit Conversion (Explicit type casting in python)\n",
    "2. Implicit Conversion (Implicit type casting in python).\n",
    "### Explicit typecasting:\n",
    "The conversion of one data type into another data type, done via developer or programmer's intervention or manually as per the requirement, is known as explicit type conversion. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be achieved with the help of Python’s built-in type conversion functions such as int(), float(), hex(), oct(), str(), etc .\n",
    "### Example of explicit typecasting:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "string = \"15\"\n",
    "number = 7\n",
    "string_number = int(string) #throws an error if the string is not a valid integer\n",
    "sum= number + string_number\n",
    "print(\"The Sum of both the numbers is: \", sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Sum of both the numbers is 22\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Implicit type casting:\n",
    "Data types in Python do not have the same level i.e. ordering of data types is not the same in Python. Some of the data types have higher-order, and some have lower order. While performing any operations on variables with different data types in Python, one of the variable's data types will be changed to the higher data type. According to the level, one data type is converted into other by the Python interpreter itself (automatically). This is called, implicit typecasting in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python converts a smaller data type to a higher data type to prevent data loss.\n",
    "### Example of implicit type casting:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python automatically converts\n",
    "# a to int\n",
    "a = 7\n",
    "print(type(a))\n",
    " \n",
    "# Python automatically converts b to float\n",
    "b = 3.0\n",
    "print(type(b))\n",
    " \n",
    "# Python automatically converts c to float as it is a float addition\n",
    "c = a + b\n",
    "print(c)\n",
    "print(type(c))\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## Where to go from here:\n",
    "To continue your learning journey, consider exploring the following resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python books: There are many excellent books on Python that can help you deepen your knowledge and skills. Some popular options include \"Python Crash Course\" by Eric Matthes, \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" by Al Sweigart, and \"Fluent Python\" by Luciano Ramalho. I would also like to recommend \"Hands on Machine Learning book by Aurélien Géron\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- YouTube Projects: There are many YouTube projects available which can be watched after you have some basic understanding of python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python communities: There are many online communities where you can connect with other Python learners and experts, ask questions, and share your knowledge. Some popular options include the Python subreddit, the Python Discord server, and the Python community on Stack Overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GitHub repositories: GitHub is a great resource for finding Python projects, libraries, and code snippets. Some useful repositories to check out include \"awesome-python\" (a curated list of Python resources), \"scikit-learn\" (a machine learning library), and \"django\" (a web development framework).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Link to some resources\n",
    "- Tkinter - You can learn Tkinter which is used to create GUIs from [here](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~hv/classes/MS/TkinterPres/#Overview) :\n",
    "- Machine Learning - I loved [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal) playlist from Google Developers\n",
    "- Django - For Django, try the [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) from the official documentation. Trust me its really good\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the key to mastering Python (or any programming language) is to keep practicing and experimenting. Set yourself challenges, work on personal projects, and stay curious. Good luck!\n"

    "# What are strings?\n",
    "In python, anything that you enclose between single or double quotation marks is considered a string. A string is essentially a sequence or array of textual data. Strings are used when working with Unicode characters. \n",

    "Hello, Harry\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It does not matter whether you enclose your strings in single or double quotes, the output remains the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the user might need to put quotation marks in between the strings. Example, consider the sentence: He said, “I want to eat an apple”.\n",
    "\n",
    "How will you print this statement in python?: \n",
    "```He said, \"I want to eat an apple\".```\n",

    "print('He said, \"I want to eat an apple\".')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiline Strings\n",

    "# Python Functions\n",
    "A function is a block of code that performs a specific task whenever it is called. In bigger programs, where we have large amounts of code, it is advisable to create or use existing functions that make the program flow organized and neat.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Built-in functions\n",
    "2. User-defined functions\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " ## Built-in functions:\n",
    "These functions are defined and pre-coded in python. Some examples of built-in functions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "min(), max(), len(), sum(), type(), range(), dict(), list(), tuple(), set(), print(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## User-defined functions:\n",
    "We can create functions to perform specific tasks as per our needs. Such functions are called user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "  # Code and Statements\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "- Create a function using the def keyword, followed by a function name, followed by a paranthesis (()) and a colon(:).\n",
    " - Any parameters and arguments should be placed within the parentheses.\n",
    " - Rules to naming function are similar to that of naming variables.\n",
    " - Any statements and other code within the function should be indented.\n",
    "### Calling a function:\n",
    "We call a function by giving the function name, followed by parameters (if any) in the parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name(fname, lname):\n",

    "# Function Arguments and return statement\n",
    "There are four types of arguments that we can provide in a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Default Arguments\n",
    "- Keyword Arguments\n",
    "- Variable length Arguments\n",
    "- Required Arguments\n",
    "### Default arguments:\n",
    "We can provide a default value while creating a function. This way the function assumes a default value even if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name(fname, mname = \"Jhon\", lname = \"Whatson\"):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello,\", fname, mname, lname)\n",
    "\n",
    "name(\"Amy\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Amy Jhon Whatson\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyword arguments:\n",
    "We can provide arguments with key = value, this way the interpreter recognizes the arguments by the parameter name. Hence, the the order in which the arguments are passed does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name(fname, mname, lname):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello,\", fname, mname, lname)\n",
    "\n",
    "name(mname = \"Peter\", lname = \"Wesker\", fname = \"Jade\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Jade Peter Wesker\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required arguments:\n",
    "In case we don’t pass the arguments with a key = value syntax, then it is necessary to pass the arguments in the correct positional order and the number of arguments passed should match with actual function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: when number of arguments passed does not match to the actual function definition.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name(fname, mname, lname):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello,\", fname, mname, lname)\n",
    "\n",
    "name(\"Peter\", \"Quill\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "name(\"Peter\", \"Quill\")\\\n",
    "TypeError: name() missing 1 required positional argument: 'lname'\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: when number of arguments passed matches to the actual function definition.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name(fname, mname, lname):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello,\", fname, mname, lname)\n",
    "\n",
    "name(\"Peter\", \"Ego\", \"Quill\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Peter Ego Quill\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable-length arguments:\n",
    "Sometimes we may need to pass more arguments than those defined in the actual function. This can be done using variable-length arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arbitrary Arguments:\n",
    "While creating a function, pass a * before the parameter name while defining the function. The function accesses the arguments by processing them in the form of tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name(*name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello,\", name[0], name[1], name[2])\n",
    "\n",
    "name(\"James\", \"Buchanan\", \"Barnes\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, James Buchanan Barnes\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keyword Arbitrary Arguments:\n",
    "While creating a function, pass a * before the parameter name while defining the function. The function accesses the arguments by processing them in the form of dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name(**name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello,\", name[\"fname\"], name[\"mname\"], name[\"lname\"])\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, James Buchanan Barnes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## return Statement\n",
    "The return statement is used to return the value of the expression back to the calling function.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name(fname, mname, lname):\n",
    "    return \"Hello, \" + fname + \" \" + mname + \" \" + lname\n",

    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing list items\n",
    " We can access list items by using its index with the square bracket syntax []. For example colors[0] will give \"Red\", colors[1] will give \"Green\" and so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Positive Indexing:\n",
    "As we have seen that list items have index, as such we can access items using these indexes.\n",

    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "colors = [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\", \"Yellow\", \"Green\"]\n",
    "#          [0]      [1]     [2]      [3]      [4]\n",

    "Red\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Negative Indexing:\n",
    "Similar to positive indexing, negative indexing is also used to access items, but from the end of the list. The last item has index [-1], second last item has index [-2], third last item has index [-3] and so on.\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "colors = [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\", \"Yellow\", \"Green\"]\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: The element of the end index provided will not be included. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "# Tuple Indexes\n",
    "Each item/element in a tuple has its own unique index. This index can be used to access any particular item from the tuple. The first item has index [0], second item has index [1], third item has index [2] and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "country = (\"Spain\", \"Italy\", \"India\",)\n",
    "#            [0]      [1]      [2]              \n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing tuple items:\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Positive Indexing:\n",
    "As we have seen that tuple items have index, as such we can access items using these indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "country = (\"Spain\", \"Italy\", \"India\",)\n",
    "#            [0]      [1]      [2]     \n",
    "print(country[0])\n",
    "print(country[1])\n",
    "print(country[2])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Spain\n",
    "Italy\n",
    "India\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Negative Indexing:\n",
    "Similar to positive indexing, negative indexing is also used to access items, but from the end of the tuple. The last item has index [-1], second last item has index [-2], third last item has index [-3] and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "country = (\"Spain\", \"Italy\", \"India\", \"England\", \"Germany\")\n",
    "#            [0]      [1]      [2]       [3]        [4]\n",
    "print(country[-1]) # Similar to print(country[len(country) - 1])\n",
    "print(country[-3])\n",
    "print(country[-4])\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Germany\n",
    "India\n",
    "Italy\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## III. Check for item:\n",
    "We can check if a given item is present in the tuple. This is done using the `in` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "country = (\"Spain\", \"Italy\", \"India\", \"England\", \"Germany\")\n",
    "if \"Germany\" in country:\n",
    "    print(\"Germany is present.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Germany is absent.\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Germany is present.\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "country = (\"Spain\", \"Italy\", \"India\", \"England\", \"Germany\")\n",
    "if \"Russia\" in country:\n",
    "    print(\"Russia is present.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Russia is absent.\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Russia is absent.\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### IV. Range of Index:\n",
    "You can print a range of tuple items by specifying where do you want to start, where do you want to end and if you want to skip elements in between the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Tuple[start : end : jumpIndex]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: jump Index is optional. We will see this in given examples.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Printing elements within a particular range:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "animals = (\"cat\", \"dog\", \"bat\", \"mouse\", \"pig\", \"horse\", \"donkey\", \"goat\", \"cow\")\n",
    "print(animals[3:7])     #using positive indexes\n",
    "print(animals[-7:-2])   #using negative indexes\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "('mouse', 'pig', 'horse', 'donkey')\n",
    "('bat', 'mouse', 'pig', 'horse', 'donkey')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we provide index of the element from where we want to start and the index of the element till which we want to print the values. \n",
    "Note: The element of the end index provided will not be included.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Printing all element from a given index till the end\n",
    "```python\n",
    "animals = (\"cat\", \"dog\", \"bat\", \"mouse\", \"pig\", \"horse\", \"donkey\", \"goat\", \"cow\")\n",
    "print(animals[4:])      #using positive indexes\n",
    "print(animals[-4:])     #using negative indexes\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "('pig', 'horse', 'donkey', 'goat', 'cow')\n",
    "('horse', 'donkey', 'goat', 'cow') \n",
    "```\n",
    "When no end index is provided, the interpreter prints all the values till the end.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: printing all elements from start to a given index\n",
    "```python\n",
    "animals = (\"cat\", \"dog\", \"bat\", \"mouse\", \"pig\", \"horse\", \"donkey\", \"goat\", \"cow\")\n",
    "print(animals[:6])      #using positive indexes\n",
    "print(animals[:-3])     #using negative indexes\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "('cat', 'dog', 'bat', 'mouse', 'pig', 'horse')\n",
    "('cat', 'dog', 'bat', 'mouse', 'pig', 'horse')\n",
    "```\n",
    "When no start index is provided, the interpreter prints all the values from start up to the end index provided. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Print alternate values\n",
    "```python\n",
    "animals = (\"cat\", \"dog\", \"bat\", \"mouse\", \"pig\", \"horse\", \"donkey\", \"goat\", \"cow\")\n",
    "print(animals[::2])     #using positive indexes\n",
    "print(animals[-8:-1:2]) #using negative indexes\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "('cat', 'bat', 'pig', 'donkey', 'cow')\n",
    "('dog', 'mouse', 'horse', 'goat')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we have not provided start and end index, which means all the values will be considered. But as we have provided a jump index of 2 only alternate values will be printed. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: printing every 3rd consecutive withing given range\n",
    "```python\n",
    "animals = (\"cat\", \"dog\", \"bat\", \"mouse\", \"pig\", \"horse\", \"donkey\", \"goat\", \"cow\")\n",
    "print(animals[1:8:3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "('dog', 'pig', 'goat')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, jump index is 3. Hence it prints every 3rd element within given index.\n",

    "\n",
    "## How importing in python works\n",
    "Importing in Python is the process of loading code from a Python module into the current script. This allows you to use the functions and variables defined in the module in your current script, as well as any additional modules that the imported module may depend on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To import a module in Python, you use the import statement followed by the name of the module. For example, to import the math module, which contains a variety of mathematical functions, you would use the following statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once a module is imported, you can use any of the functions and variables defined in the module by using the dot notation. For example, to use the sqrt function from the math module, you would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "result = math.sqrt(9)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 3.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## from keyword\n",
    "You can also import specific functions or variables from a module using the from keyword. For example, to import only the sqrt function from the math module, you would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from math import sqrt\n",
    "\n",
    "result = sqrt(9)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 3.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also import multiple functions or variables at once by separating them with a comma:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from math import sqrt, pi\n",
    "\n",
    "result = sqrt(9)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "print(pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## importing everything\n",
    "It's also possible to import all functions and variables from a module using the * wildcard. However, this is generally not recommended as it can lead to confusion and make it harder to understand where specific functions and variables are coming from.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from math import *\n",
    "\n",
    "result = sqrt(9)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "print(pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python also allows you to rename imported modules using the as keyword. This can be useful if you want to use a shorter or more descriptive name for a module, or if you want to avoid naming conflicts with other modules or variables in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The \"as\" keyword\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math as m\n",
    "\n",
    "result = m.sqrt(9)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "print(m.pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793\n",
    "```\n",
    "## The dir function\n",
    "Finally, Python has a built-in function called dir that you can use to view the names of all the functions and variables defined in a module. This can be helpful for exploring and understanding the contents of a new module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dir(math))\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will output a list of all the names defined in the math module, including functions like sqrt and pi, as well as other variables and constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the import statement in Python allows you to access the functions and variables defined in a module from within your current script. You can import the entire module, specific functions or variables, or use the * wildcard to import everything. You can also use the as keyword to rename a module, and the dir function to view the contents of a module.\n",

    "\n",
    "## `if \"__name__ == \"__main__\"` in Python\n",
    "The if `__name__ == \"__main__\"` idiom is a common pattern used in Python scripts to determine whether the script is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `__name__` variable is a built-in variable that is automatically set to the name of the current module. When a Python script is run directly, the `__name__` variable is set to the string `__main__` When the script is imported as a module into another script, the `__name__` variable is set to the name of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how the if `__name__` == `__main__` idiom can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    # Code to be run when the script is run directly\n",
    "    print(\"Running script directly\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the main function contains the code that should be run when the script is run directly. The if statement at the bottom checks whether the `__name__` variable is equal to `__main__`. If it is, the main function is called.\n",
    "## Why is it useful?\n",
    "This idiom is useful because it allows you to reuse code from a script by importing it as a module into another script, without running the code in the original script. For example, consider the following script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    print(\"Running script directly\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you run this script directly, it will output \"Running script directly\". However, if you import it as a module into another script and call the main function from the imported module, it will not output anything:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import script\n",
    "\n",
    "script.main()  # Output: \"Running script directly\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This can be useful if you have code that you want to reuse in multiple scripts, but you only want it to run when the script is run directly and not when it's imported as a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Is it a necessity?\n",
    "It's important to note that the `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` idiom is not required to run a Python script. You can still run a script without it by simply calling the functions or running the code you want to execute directly. However, the `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` idiom can be a useful tool for organizing and separating code that should be run directly from code that should be imported and used as a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` idiom is a common pattern used in Python scripts to determine whether the script is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script.

    "\n",
    "Reading and writing files\n",
    "The os module provides functions for opening, reading, and writing files. For example, to open a file for reading, you can use the open function:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the file in read-only mode\n",

    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a global variable is a variable that is defined outside of a function and is accessible from within any function in your code.\n",

    "Python provides several ways to manipulate files. Today, we will discuss how to handle files in Python.\n",
    "## Opening a File\n",
    "Before we can perform any operations on a file, we must first open it. Python provides the open() function to open a file. It takes two arguments: the name of the file and the mode in which the file should be opened. The mode can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, or 'a' for appending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to open a file for reading:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open('myfile.txt', 'r')\n",
    "```\n",
    "By default, the open() function returns a file object that can be used to read from or write to the file, depending on the mode.\n",
    "## Modes in file\n",
    "There are various modes in which we can open files.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. read (r): This mode opens the file for reading only and gives an error if the file does not exist. This is the default mode if no mode is passed as a parameter.\n",
    "2. write (w): This mode opens the file for writing only and creates a new file if the file does not exist.\n",
    "3. append (a): This mode opens the file for appending only and creates a new file if the file does not exist.\n",
    "4. create (x): This mode creates a file and gives an error if the file already exists.\n",
    " \n",
    "5. text (t): \n",
    "Apart from these modes we also need to specify how the file must be handled. t mode is used to handle text files. t refers to the text mode. There is no difference between r and rt or w and wt since text mode is the default. The default mode is 'r' (open for reading text, synonym of 'rt' ).\n",
    "6. binary (b): used to handle binary files (images, pdfs, etc).\n",
    "## Reading from a File\n",
    "Once we have a file object, we can use various methods to read from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The read() method reads the entire contents of the file and returns it as a string.\n",
    "```python \n",
    "f = open('myfile.txt', 'r')\n",
    "contents = f.read()\n",
    "print(contents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing to a File\n",
    "To write to a file, we first need to open it in write mode.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open('myfile.txt', 'w')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can then use the write() method to write to the file.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open('myfile.txt', 'w')\n",
    "f.write('Hello, world!')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Keep in mind that writing to a file will overwrite its contents. If you want to append to a file instead of overwriting it, you can open it in append mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "f = open('myfile.txt', 'a')\n",
    "f.write('Hello, world!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Closing a File\n",
    "It is important to close a file after you are done with it. This releases the resources used by the file and allows other programs to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To close a file, you can use the close() method.\n",
    "```python \n",
    "f = open('myfile.txt', 'r')\n",
    "# ... do something with the file\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Print the sum\n",
    "print(sum)\n",

    "# Introduction to Object-oriented programming\n",
    "Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python: In programming languages, mainly there are two approaches that are used to write program or code.\n",
    "- 1). Procedural Programming\n",
    "- 2). Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure we are following till now is the “Procedural Programming” approach. So, in this session, we will learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "The basic idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is to use classes and objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object of that class will have. Properties are the data or state of an object, and methods are the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods. For example, you could create a class called \"Person\" that has properties such as name and age, and methods such as speak() and walk(). Each instance of the Person class would be a unique object with its own name and age, but they would all have the same methods to speak and walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of OOP in Python is encapsulation, which means that the internal state of an object is hidden and can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods. This helps to protect the object's data and prevent it from being modified in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key feature of OOP in Python is inheritance, which allows new classes to be created that inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. This allows for code reuse and makes it easy to create new classes that have similar functionality to existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is also supported in Python, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class. This allows for greater flexibility in code and makes it easier to write code that can work with multiple types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, OOP in Python allows developers to model real-world concepts and entities using classes and objects, encapsulate data, reuse code through inheritance, and write more flexible code through polymorphism.\n",

    "Python decorators are a powerful and versatile tool that allow you to modify the behavior of functions and methods. They are a way to extend the functionality of a function or method without modifying its source code.\n",

    "A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that modifies the behavior of the original function. The new function is often referred to as a \"decorated\" function. The basic syntax for using a decorator is the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@decorator_function\n",
    "def my_function():\n",

    "```\n",
    "Decorators are often used to add functionality to functions and methods, such as logging, memoization, and access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical use case\n",
    "One common use of decorators is to add logging to a function. For example, you could use a decorator to log the arguments and return value of a function each time it is called:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "def log_function_call(func):\n",

    "        logging.info(f\"Calling {func.__name__} with args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}\")\n",
    "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "        logging.info(f\"{func.__name__} returned {result}\")\n",
    "        return result\n",

    "def my_function(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",

    "In this example, the log_function_call decorator takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that logs the function call before and after the original function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Decorators are a powerful and flexible feature in Python that can be used to add functionality to functions and methods without modifying their source code. They are a great tool for separating concerns, reducing code duplication, and making your code more readable and maintainable.\n",

    "Getters in Python are methods that are used to access the values of an object's properties. They are used to return the value of a specific property, and are typically defined using the @property decorator.\n",

    "        return self._value\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the MyClass class has a single property, _value, which is initialized in the __init__ method. The value method is defined as a getter using the @property decorator, and is used to return the value of the _value property.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the getter, we can create an instance of the MyClass class, and then access the value property as if it were an attribute:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> obj = MyClass(10)\n",
    ">>> obj.value\n",
    "10\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Setters\n",
    "It is important to note that the getters do not take any parameters and we cannot set the value through getter method.For that we need setter method which can be added by decorating method with @property_name.setter\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a class with both getter and setter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self._value = value\n",

    "        return self._value\n",
    "\n",
    "    @value.setter\n",
    "    def value(self, new_value):\n",
    "        self._value = new_value\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can use setter method like this:\n",

    ">>> obj = MyClass(10)\n",
    ">>> obj.value = 20\n",
    ">>> obj.value\n",
    "20\n",

    "Class variables are defined at the class level and are shared among all instances of the class. They are defined outside of any method and are usually used to store information that is common to all instances of the class. For example, a class variable can be used to store the number of instances of a class that have been created.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Instance Variables\n",
    "Instance variables are defined at the instance level and are unique to each instance of the class. They are defined inside the __init__ method and are usually used to store information that is specific to each instance of the class. For example, an instance variable can be used to store the name of an employee in a class that represents an employee.\n",

    "\n",
    "obj1.print_name() # Output: John\n",
    "obj2.print_name() # Output: Jane\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, each instance of the class MyClass has its own value for the name variable. When we call the print_name method on obj1 and obj2, we get different values for name.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In summary, class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are used to store information that is common to all instances. Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class and are used to store information that is specific to each instance. Understanding the difference between class variables and instance variables is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable code in Python.\n",

They are defined in the class level and can be accessed via classname.varibale_name or self.class.variable_name.

    "# Python Class Methods\n",
    "## Python Class Methods: An Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, classes are a way to define custom data types that can store data and define functions that can manipulate that data. One type of function that can be defined within a class is called a \"method.\" In this blog post, we will explore what Python class methods are, why they are useful, and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Python Class Methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class method is a type of method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. In other words, it operates on the class as a whole, rather than on a specific instance of the class. Class methods are defined using the \"@classmethod\" decorator, followed by a function definition. The first argument of the function is always \"cls,\" which represents the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Python Class Methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods are useful in several situations. For example, you might want to create a factory method that creates instances of your class in a specific way. You could define a class method that creates the instance and returns it to the caller. Another common use case is to provide alternative constructors for your class. This can be useful if you want to create instances of your class in multiple ways, but still have a consistent interface for doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use Python Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a class method, you simply use the \"@classmethod\" decorator before the method definition. The first argument of the method should always be \"cls,\" which represents the class itself. Here is an example of how to define a class method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ExampleClass:\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def factory_method(cls, argument1, argument2):\n",
    "        return cls(argument1, argument2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"factory_method\" is a class method that takes two arguments, \"argument1\" and \"argument2.\" It creates a new instance of the class \"ExampleClass\" using the \"cls\" keyword, and returns the new instance to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that class methods cannot modify the class in any way. If you need to modify the class, you should use a class level variable instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Python class methods are a powerful tool for defining functions that operate on the class as a whole, rather than on a specific instance of the class. They are useful for creating factory methods, alternative constructors, and other types of methods that operate at the class level. With the knowledge of how to define and use class methods, you can start writing more complex and organized code in Python.\n",

    "# Class Methods as Alternative Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, the term \"constructor\" refers to a special type of method that is automatically executed when an object is created from a class. The purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object's attributes, allowing the object to be fully functional and ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are times when you may want to create an object in a different way, or with different initial values, than what is provided by the default constructor. This is where class methods can be used as alternative constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class method belongs to the class rather than to an instance of the class. One common use case for class methods as alternative constructors is when you want to create an object from data that is stored in a different format, such as a string or a dictionary. For example, consider a class named \"Person\" that has two attributes: \"name\" and \"age\". The default constructor for the class might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you want to create a Person object from a string that contains the person's name and age, separated by a comma? You can define a class method named \"from_string\" to do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def from_string(cls, string):\n",
    "        name, age = string.split(',')\n",
    "        return cls(name, int(age))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you can create a Person object from a string like this:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "person = Person.from_string(\"John Doe, 30\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common use case for class methods as alternative constructors is when you want to create an object with a different set of default values than what is provided by the default constructor.

    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "    self.width = width\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `__dict__` attribute\n",
    "``__dict__``: The `__dict__` attribute returns a dictionary representation of an object's attributes. It is a useful tool for introspection.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> class Person:\n",
    "...     def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

    "```\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}\n",
    "```\n",
    "## The help() mehthod\n",
    "`help()`: The help() function is used to get help documentation for an object, including a description of its attributes and methods.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> help(str)\n",
    "Help on class str in module builtins:\n",
    "\n",
    "class str(object)\n",
    " |  str(object='') -> str\n",
    " |  str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str\n",
    " |\n",
    " |  Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or\n",
    " |  errors is specified, then the object must expose a data buffer\n",
    " |  that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.\n",

    " |  encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().\n",
    " |  errors defaults to 'strict'.\n",

    "# Super keyword in Python \n",
    "The super() keyword in Python is used to refer to the parent class. It is especially useful when a class inherits from multiple parent classes and you want to call a method from one of the parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class inherits from a parent class, it can override or extend the methods defined in the parent class. However, sometimes you might want to use the parent class method in the child class. This is where the super() keyword comes in handy.\n",

    "Here's an example of how to use the super() keyword in a simple inheritance scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ParentClass:\n",
    "    def parent_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is the parent method.\")\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "This is the child method.\n",
    "This is the parent method.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "In this example, we have a ParentClass with a parent_method and a ChildClass that inherits from ParentClass and overrides the child_method. When the child_method is called, it first prints \"This is the child method.\" and then calls the parent_method using the super() keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The super() keyword is also useful when a class inherits from multiple parent classes. In this case, you can specify the parent class from which you want to call the method.\n",

    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ParentClass1:\n",
    "    def parent_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is the parent method of ParentClass1.\")\n",

    "These are just a few of the many magic methods available in Python. They are incredibly powerful tools that allow you to customize the behaviour of your objects, and can make your code much cleaner and easier to understand.

    "\n",
    "Method overriding is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming that allows you to redefine a method in a derived class. The method in the derived class is said to override the method in the base class. When you create an instance of the derived class and call the overridden method, the version of the method in the derived class is executed, rather than the version in the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, method overriding is a way to customize the behavior of a class based on its specific needs. For example, consider the following base class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this base class, the area method is defined, but does not have any implementation. If you want to create a derived class that represents a circle, you can override the area method and provide an implementation that calculates the area of a circle:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",

    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the Circle class inherits from the Shape class, and overrides the area method. The new implementation of the area method calculates the area of a circle, based on its radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when you override a method, the new implementation must have the same method signature as the original method. This means that the number and type of arguments, as well as the return type, must be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to customize the behavior of a class is to call the base class method from the derived class method. To do this, you can use the super function. The super function allows you to call the base class method from the derived class method, and can be useful when you want to extend the behavior of the base class method, rather than replace it.\n",

    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Calculating area...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this base class, the area method prints a message indicating that the area is being calculated. If you want to create a derived class that represents a circle, and you also want to print a message indicating the type of shape, you can use the super function to call the base class method, and add your own message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",

    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the Circle class overrides the area method, and calls the base class method using the super function. This allows you to extend the behavior of the base class method, while still maintaining its original behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, method overriding is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to customize the behavior of a class based on its specific needs. By using method overriding, you can create more robust and reliable code, and ensure that your classes behave in the way that you need them to. Additionally, by using the super function, you can extend the behavior of a base class method, rather than replace it, giving you even greater flexibility and control over the behavior of your classes.\n",

    "## Why do we need operator overloading?\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading allows you to create more readable and intuitive code. For instance, consider a custom class that represents a point in 2D space. You could define a method called 'add' to add two points together, but using the + operator makes the code more concise and readable:\n",

    "# Multilevel Inheritance in Python\n",
    "Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in object-oriented programming where a derived class inherits from another derived class. This type of inheritance allows you to build a hierarchy of classes where one class builds upon another, leading to a more specialized class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, multilevel inheritance is achieved by using the class hierarchy. The syntax for multilevel inheritance is quite simple and follows the same syntax as single inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "class BaseClass:\n",
    "    # Base class code\n",
    "    \n",
    "class DerivedClass1(BaseClass):\n",
    "    # Derived class 1 code\n",
    "    \n",
    "class DerivedClass2(DerivedClass1):\n",
    "    # Derived class 2 code\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example, we have three classes: `BaseClass`, `DerivedClass1`, and `DerivedClass2`. The `DerivedClass1` class inherits from the `BaseClass`, and the `DerivedClass2` class inherits from the `DerivedClass1` class. This creates a hierarchy where `DerivedClass2` has access to all the attributes and methods of both `DerivedClass1` and `BaseClass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example to understand how multilevel inheritance works in Python. Consider the following classes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, species):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.species = species\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def show_details(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Name: {self.name}\")\n",
    "        print(f\"Species: {self.species}\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        Animal.__init__(self, name, species=\"Dog\")\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def show_details(self):\n",
    "        Animal.show_details(self)\n",
    "        print(f\"Breed: {self.breed}\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "class GoldenRetriever(Dog):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, color):\n",
    "        Dog.__init__(self, name, breed=\"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def show_details(self):\n",
    "        Dog.show_details(self)\n",
    "        print(f\"Color: {self.color}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we have three classes: `Animal`, `Dog`, and `GoldenRetriever`. The `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class, and the `GoldenRetriever` class inherits from the `Dog` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we create an object of the `GoldenRetriever` class, it has access to all the attributes and methods of the `Animal` class and the `Dog` class. We can also see that the `GoldenRetriever` class has its own attributes and methods that are specific to the class.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dog = GoldenRetriever(\"Max\", \"Golden\")\n",
    "dog.show_details()\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Name: Max\n",
    "Species: Dog\n",
    "Breed: Golden Retriever\n",
    "Color: Golden\n",
    "```\n",
    "As we can see from the output, the `GoldenRetriever` object has access to all the attributes and methods of the `Animal` and `Dog` classes, and, it has also added its own unique attributes and methods. This is a powerful feature of multilevel inheritance, as it allows you to create more complex and intricate classes by building upon existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of multilevel inheritance is that it allows you to reuse code and avoid repeating the same logic multiple times. This can lead to better maintainability and readability of your code, as you can abstract away complex logic into base classes and build upon them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, multilevel inheritance is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming that allows you to create complex and intricate classes by building upon existing ones. It provides the benefits of code reuse, maintainability, and readability, while also requiring careful consideration to avoid potential problems.\n",

    "Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and single inheritance in object-oriented programming.

    "The syntax for implementing Hybrid Inheritance in Python is the same as for implementing Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, or Hierarchical Inheritance.\n",

    "# The time Module in Python\n",
    "The `time` module in Python provides a set of functions to work with time-related operations, such as timekeeping, formatting, and time conversions. This module is part of the Python Standard Library and is available in all Python installations, making it a convenient and essential tool for a wide range of applications. In this day 84 tutorial, we'll explore the `time` module in Python and see how it can be used in different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## time.time()\n",
    "The `time.time()` function returns the current time as a floating-point number, representing the number of seconds since the epoch (the point in time when the time module was initialized). The returned value is based on the computer's system clock and is affected by time adjustments made by the operating system, such as daylight saving time. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "print(time.time())\n",
    "# Output: 1602299933.233374\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the function returns the current time as a floating-point number, which can be used for various purposes, such as measuring the duration of an operation or the elapsed time since a certain point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## time.sleep()\n",
    "The `time.sleep()` function suspends the execution of the current thread for a specified number of seconds. This function can be used to pause the program for a certain period of time, allowing other parts of the program to run, or to synchronize the execution of multiple threads. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Start:\", time.time())\n",
    "time.sleep(2)\n",
    "print(\"End:\", time.time())\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Start: 1602299933.233374\n",
    "# End: 1602299935.233376\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the function `time.sleep()` suspends the execution of the program for 2 seconds, allowing other parts of the program to run during that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## time.strftime()\n",
    "The `time.strftime()` function formats a time value as a string, based on a specified format. This function is particularly useful for formatting dates and times in a human-readable format, such as for display in a GUI, a log file, or a report. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "t = time.localtime()\n",
    "formatted_time = time.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\", t)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(formatted_time)\n",
    "# Output: 2022-11-08 08:45:33\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the function `time.strftime()` formats the current time (obtained using `time.localtime()`) as a string, using a specified format. The format string contains codes that represent different parts of the time value, such as the year, the month, the day, the hour, the minute, and the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The `time` module in Python provides a set of functions to work with time-related operations, such as timekeeping, formatting, and `time` conversions. Whether you are writing a script, a library, or an application, the `time` module is a powerful tool that can help you perform time-related tasks with ease and efficiency. So, if you haven't already, be sure to check out the time module in Python and see how it can help you write better, more efficient code.\n",

    "\n",
    "# The Walrus Operator in Python\n",
    "The Walrus Operator is a new addition to Python 3.8 and allows you to assign a value to a variable within an expression. This can be useful when you need to use a value multiple times in a loop, but don't want to repeat the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Walrus Operator is represented by the `:=` syntax and can be used in a variety of contexts including while loops and if statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you can use the Walrus Operator in a while loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "while (n := len(numbers)) > 0:\n",
    "    print(numbers.pop())\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the length of the `numbers` list is assigned to the variable n using the Walrus Operator. The value of `n` is then used in the condition of the while loop, so that the loop will continue to execute until the `numbers` list is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of using the Walrus Operator in an if statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = [\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Jim\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "if (name := input(\"Enter a name: \")) in names:\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Name not found.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here is another example \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# walrus operator :=\n",
    "\n",
    "# new to Python 3.8\n",
    "# assignment expression aka walrus operator\n",
    "# assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression\n",
    "\n",
    "# happy = True\n",
    "# print(happy)\n",
    "\n",
    "# print(happy := True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# foods = list()\n",
    "# while True:\n",
    "#   food = input(\"What food do you like?: \")\n",
    "#       if food == \"quit\":\n",
    "#           break\n",
    "#   foods.append(food)\n",
    "\n",
    "foods = list()\n",
    "while (food := input(\"What food do you like?: \")) != \"quit\":\n",
    "    foods.append(food)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the user input is assigned to the variable `name` using the Walrus Operator. The value of `name` is then used in the if statement to determine whether it is in the names list. If it is, the corresponding message is printed, otherwise, a different message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the Walrus Operator should be used sparingly as it can make code less readable if overused.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the Walrus Operator is a useful tool for Python developers to have in their toolkit. It can help streamline code and reduce duplication, but it should be used with care to ensure code readability and maintainability.\n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "The following are some of the most commonly used functions in the shutil module:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `shutil.copy(src, dst)`: This function copies the file located at src to a new location specified by dst. If the destination location already exists, the original file will be overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `shutil.copy2(src, dst)`: This function is similar to shutil.copy, but it also preserves more metadata about the original file, such as the timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `shutil.copytree(src, dst)`: This function recursively copies the directory located at src to a new location specified by dst. If the destination location already exists, the original directory will be merged with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `shutil.move(src, dst)`: This function moves the file located at src to a new location specified by dst. This function is equivalent to renaming a file in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `shutil.rmtree(path)`: This function recursively deletes the directory located at path, along with all of its contents. This function is similar to using the rm -rf command in a shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "Here are some examples of how you can use the shutil module in your Python code:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Deleting a directory\n",
    "shutil.rmtree(\"dir\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the shutil module provides a simple and efficient way to perform common file and directory-related tasks in Python. Whether you need to copy, move, delete, or preserve metadata about files and directories, the shutil module has you covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the shutil module is a powerful tool for automating file and directory-related tasks in Python. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced Python developer, the shutil module is an essential tool to have in your toolbox.\n",

    "# Generators in Python\n",
    "Generators in Python are special type of functions that allow you to create an iterable sequence of values. A generator function returns a generator object, which can be used to generate the values one-by-one as you iterate over it. Generators are a powerful tool for working with large or complex data sets, as they allow you to generate the values on-the-fly, rather than having to create and store the entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Generator\n",
    "In Python, you can create a generator by using the `yield` statement in a function. The `yield` statement returns a value from the generator and suspends the execution of the function until the next value is requested. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_generator():\n",
    "    for i in range(5):\n",
    "        yield i\n",
    "\n",
    "gen = my_generator()\n",
    "print(next(gen))\n",
    "print(next(gen))\n",
    "print(next(gen))\n",
    "print(next(gen))\n",
    "print(next(gen))\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 0\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the generator function `my_generator()` returns a generator object, which can be used to generate the values in the range 0 to 4. The `next()` function is used to request the next value from the generator, and the generator resumes its execution until it encounters another `yield` statement or until it reaches the end of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a Generator\n",
    "Once you have created a generator, you can use it in a variety of ways, such as in a for loop, a list comprehension, or a generator expression. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gen = my_generator()\n",
    "for i in gen:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 0\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the generator can be used in a for loop, just like any other iterable sequence. The generator is used to generate the values one-by-one as the loop iterates over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Generators\n",
    "Generators offer several benefits over other types of sequences, such as lists, tuples, and sets. One of the main benefits of generators is that they allow you to generate the values on-the-fly, rather than having to create and store the entire sequence in memory. This makes generators a powerful tool for working with large or complex data sets, as you can generate the values as you need them, rather than having to store them all in memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of generators is that they are lazy, which means that the values are generated only when they are requested. This allows you to generate the values in a more efficient and memory-friendly manner, as you don't have to generate all the values up front.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Generators in Python are a powerful tool for working with large or complex data sets, allowing you to generate the values on-the-fly and store only what you need in memory. Whether you are working with a large dataset, performing complex calculations, or generating a sequence of values, generators are a must-have tool in your programming toolkit. So, if you haven't already, be sure to check out generators in Python and see how they can help you write better, more efficient code.\n",

    "# Function Caching in Python \n",
    "Function caching is a technique for improving the performance of a program by storing the results of a function call so that you can reuse the results instead of recomputing them every time the function is called. This can be particularly useful when a function is computationally expensive, or when the inputs to the function are unlikely to change frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, function caching can be achieved using the functools.lru_cache decorator. The functools.lru_cache decorator is used to cache the results of a function so that you can reuse the results instead of recomputing them every time the function is called. Here's an example:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import functools\n",

    "def fib(n):\n",
    "    if n < 2:\n",

    "    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fib(20))\n",
    "# Output: 6765\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the `functools.lru_cache` decorator is used to cache the results of the `fib` function. The `maxsize` parameter is used to specify the maximum number of results to cache. If `maxsize` is set to `None`, the cache will have an unlimited size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Function Caching\n",
    "Function caching can have a significant impact on the performance of a program, particularly for computationally expensive functions. By caching the results of a function, you can avoid having to recompute the results every time the function is called, which can save a significant amount of time and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of function caching is that it can simplify the code of a program by removing the need to manually cache the results of a function. With the `functools.lru_cache` decorator, the caching is handled automatically, so you can focus on writing the core logic of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Function caching is a technique for improving the performance of a program by storing the results of a function so that you can reuse the results instead of recomputing them every time the function is called. In Python 3, function caching can be achieved using the `functools.lru_cache` decorator, which provides an easy and efficient way to cache the results of a function. Whether you're writing a computationally expensive program, or just want to simplify your code, function caching is a great technique to have in your toolbox.\n",

    "Congratulations on completing the 100 days of Python code challenge! You have likely gained a solid foundation in the language and developed a range of skills, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming. However, this is just the beginning of your journey with Python. There are many more topics to explore, including machine learning, web development, game development, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where to go from here:\n",
    "To continue your learning journey, consider exploring the following resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python books: There are many excellent books on Python that can help you deepen your knowledge and skills. Some popular options include \"Python Crash Course\" by Eric Matthes, \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" by Al Sweigart, and \"Fluent Python\" by Luciano Ramalho. I would also like to recommend \"Hands on Machine Learning book by Aurélien Géron\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- YouTube Projects: There are many YouTube projects available which can be watched after you have some basic understanding of python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python communities: There are many online communities where you can connect with other Python learners and experts, ask questions, and share your knowledge. Some popular options include the Python subreddit, the Python Discord server, and the Python community on Stack Overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GitHub repositories: GitHub is a great resource for finding Python projects, libraries, and code snippets. Some useful repositories to check out include \"awesome-python\" (a curated list of Python resources), \"scikit-learn\" (a machine learning library), and \"django\" (a web development framework).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Link to some resources\n",
    "- Tkinter - You can learn Tkinter which is used to create GUIs from [here](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~hv/classes/MS/TkinterPres/#Overview) :\n",
    "- Machine Learning - I loved [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal) playlist from Google Developers\n",
    "- Django - For Django, try the [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) from the official documentation. Trust me its really good\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the key to mastering Python (or any programming language) is to keep practicing and experimenting. Set yourself challenges, work on personal projects, and stay curious. Good luck!\n"
