    "\n",
    "`Step 1`: Encryption\n",
    "Assume we have the following 5x5 matrix of pixels as the original image:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original Image:\n",
    "[ 154, 100,  75,  80, 192 ]\n",
    "[ 201, 178, 219,  95, 112 ]\n",
    "[  48,  86, 173,  60, 104 ]\n",
    "[ 133,  12,  41,  50, 239 ]\n",
    "[  68,  23,  17, 200, 189 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the secret message to be encrypted is \"Hello.\" After encrypting the message using AES encryption, we obtain the encrypted message, which we will use for embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Step 2`: Pixel Modification\n",
    "Next, we will embed the encrypted message bits into the least significant bits (LSBs) of the pixel values using LSB substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's take the first pixel (154) and its binary representation (10011010). We will substitute the LSBs of this pixel with the first few bits of the encrypted message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the first three bits of the encrypted message are \"010.\" The modified pixel would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original Pixel: 10011010\n",
    "Modified Pixel: 1001101[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat this process for each pixel in the 5x5 matrix, modifying the LSBs based on the bits of the encrypted message until all the message bits are embedded.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Step 3`: Decryption and Extraction\n",
    "To retrieve the hidden message from the steganographic image, we reverse the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the first modified pixel from the previous step (1001101[0]). We extract the LSB and combine it with the other modified pixels to obtain the extracted message.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Modified Pixel: 1001101[0]\n",
    "Extracted Bit: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By repeating this process for each modified pixel in the steganographic image, we retrieve all the embedded bits of the encrypted message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we decrypt the extracted message using the secret key and obtain the original secret message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simplified explanation of the algorithm and the transformations that occur within a 5x5 matrix of pixels. In practice, the process may involve additional steps, such as data encoding, error correction, and statistical analysis to ensure robustness and security."

    "As an AI language model, I can provide you with an outline of an algorithm for steganography that aims to maximize the number of secret bits while maintaining the visual similarity to the original picture. However, it's important to note that steganography can be a complex field, and designing an algorithm that is truly \"unbreakable\" is extremely challenging. The strength of steganography lies in making it computationally expensive and time-consuming for potential attackers to discover the hidden message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic algorithm that you can consider as a starting point:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preprocessing:\n",
    "   - Convert the original picture to its binary representation.\n",
    "   - Generate a secret key known only to the intended recipient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Secret Bit Embedding:\n",
    "   - Divide the picture into small, non-overlapping blocks of pixels.\n",
    "   - For each block, extract the least significant bits (LSBs) of the pixel values.\n",
    "   - Replace the LSBs with the secret bits to be embedded, using a specific embedding technique (e.g., LSB substitution, random LSB substitution, or matrix encoding).\n",
    "   - Reconstruct the modified picture with the embedded secret bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Security Enhancement:\n",
    "   - Apply cryptographic techniques to the secret bits before embedding (e.g., encryption or hashing) to further enhance security.\n",
    "   - Encrypt the secret bits using the secret key to ensure that only the intended recipient can decrypt and retrieve the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Visual Similarity Preservation:\n",
    "   - During the secret bit embedding process, carefully analyze and modify the LSBs to minimize visible changes in the image.\n",
    "   - Implement techniques such as error diffusion, dithering, or adaptive pixel adjustment to maintain visual similarity between the original and modified images.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Secret Bit Extraction:\n",
    "   - To extract the secret bits, use the same algorithm and the secret key.\n",
    "   - Reconstruct the modified picture using the same block-based approach as in step 2.\n",
    "   - Extract and decrypt the embedded secret bits using the secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the security of any steganographic algorithm depends on various factors, including the embedding technique, key management, encryption strength, and the computational resources available to potential attackers. It's always advisable to consult with experts in the field and conduct thorough testing to ensure the algorithm's effectiveness."
